# Sort App with TypeScript

This app uses the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort different types of data (numbers, strings and linked lists). While building it, I practiced TypeScript concepts such as union types, type narrowing with typeof/instanceof, abstract classes and the differences between interfaces and abstract classes. Based on a Udemy course.
